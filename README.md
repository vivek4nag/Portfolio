## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React: For building a seamless UI.

- Framer Motion: For jaw-dropping animations.

- TailwindCSS: For modern, responsive styling.

- Vite: Because who has time for slow build tools?

- JavaScript: Of course, it’s JavaScript. What else?

"It’s not about the tools you use; it’s about how creatively you use them. Except for TailwindCSS… that’s just a lifesaver." 🚑
